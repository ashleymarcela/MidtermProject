# Advanced Python Calculator

## Project Description

A command-line tool called the Advanced Python Calculator is made to carry out fundamental arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction. Users can evaluate their past actions with this project's history management system, which records and stores user calculations to a CSV file.

The calculator has a plugin architecture in addition to its main features, which makes it simple to add more mathematical operations in the future. To keep an eye on its functioning and troubleshoot anyproblems, the application also has logging features.

The overall goal of this project is to create a versatile and easy-to-use calculator that can be improved over time while keeping an accurate log of user interactions.
